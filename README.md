# tsuki / ツキ
A general-purpose discord bot focused on organization. Active work in progress.

Currently a private bot, but you can run your own copy by downloading this repo and following the steps below:

1. Download & install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/).

2. Set up your Discord application and obtain a bot token by creating an application [here](https://discord.com/developers).

3. Create a file named vars.py in the same folder as tsuki.py with this line of code:

`token = '*yourtokenhere*'`

4. Go to the OAuth2 page of your Discord application, select the permissions you want your bot to have, and follow the steps on the link generated.

5. Once the bot is in your server, run tsuki.py!
