# tsuki / ツキ
A general-purpose discord bot focused on organization. Active work in progress.

Currently a private bot, but you can run your own copy with:

-Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

-discord.py (https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/)

-A Discord bot token (https://discord.com/developers)

You'll either have to modify tsuki.py & input your token directly or create a vars.py file containing the line "token = 'yourtokenhere'".
